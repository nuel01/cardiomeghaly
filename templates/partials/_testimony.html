                                I have had anxiety most of my life. Different forms of it. Ranging from social to not being able to ride in a car. And
                                sit in a show. Now my anxiety is a little obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and just being anxious. My doctors gave me
                                Lexapro and Xanax. They are helpful. All who have this condition, you are not alone.

                                I had 3 porcelain dental crowns in 2 months. One left bottom rear molar had pain that lasted for 2 weeks. Next, 2 crowns
                                on upper rear molars. One of these crowns was improperly molded. It took an hour to adjust. I returned for additional
                                adjusting. The problem crown continues to be sensitive to heat and cold plus I have nerve pain after 3 weeks. I have
                                another appointment.

                                I had a bleed on the brain back in 1996 which affected my left side, I have lost some of the use in my left hand and
                                arm, and have trouble walking. I had to learn to write right handed, as I was left handed. I have pain and burning in
                                the arm hand and leg all the time. I have been prescribed gabapentin and tramadol for the pain; it helps put does not do
                                away with it entirely
